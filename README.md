Ai_Assistant
This is an Ai_Assistant that uses Gemini API that has the capabilities to get file content and info as well as write and run python files.

This assistant does not function similarly to formal chatbots (ChatGPT,Gemini etc). 

In order to use this assistant it is recommended to download the uv dependency, this can simply be done with this command: python3 -m pip install uv

Once uv is installed, you may use the assistant with this command:


uv run main.py"YOUR PROMPT HERE"


ENJOY!!!!!
